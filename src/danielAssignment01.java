From the text, Excercise 1.3 and 1.9.  For those that do not have their text 
yet see the attachment. For exercise 1.9, you should input the literal values 
for the variables width and height from the console. Ensure you use coding 
standards such as comments and indentation. Remember that your class name 
should start with your first name followed by the name of your class. Please 
only send me your .java file. The class name should begin with your name.
